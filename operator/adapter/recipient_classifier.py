"""Recipient classification for outbound sends — the internal/external gate.

Pure, deterministic, no I/O. This module is a **byte-identical twin**: this file
(`operator/adapter/recipient_classifier.py`) and the overlay
`shared/recipient_classifier.py` MUST stay identical (recorded in
`operator/contracts/overlay-pairs.json`). Both the proactive send gate
(`hermes-smd-trust`) and the reactive reply gate (`hermes-smd-reply`) classify
recipients through this one function, so the two paths agree by construction.

Why this exists — the "nothing ever sends" root
-----------------------------------------------
A single recipient-blind ``EXTERNAL_SEND`` action class collapsed *every* send —
an internal notification to the firm's own attorney and an outbound client email
alike — onto one flat ceiling that safe-defaulted to ``draft_for_review``. That
default *is* the bug: it silently held legitimate internal traffic. This module
splits the recipient axis so a send **to a rostered internal address** resolves
to the ``external_send_internal`` action class (autonomous-capable, per the
authored exposure) while a send to anyone else stays ``external_send`` (the
outside ceiling, unchanged). The distinction is **typed and required**: an
unclassifiable recipient returns :data:`RecipientClass.UNKNOWN`, which the caller
MUST treat as a hard error — never a silent draft. Re-introducing a
"draft on unknown" default re-introduces the bug; the golden tests forbid it.

Security posture — the roster is OUTBOUND AUTHORIZATION, not inbound trust
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classifying a recipient as INTERNAL authorises an autonomous *send to them*. That
is a different, stronger trust decision than "who may trigger the agent." Hard
rules, enforced here in code:

* **Human-authored roster only.** The roster passed in MUST be human-authored
  (``scope.inbound_allow_from`` is documented human-authored; if that ever
  changes, callers pass a dedicated outbound-authorization list). If a roster
  were ever auto-grown from observed inbound correspondents, "email in → become
  rostered → receive autonomous sends" would be an exfiltration path. This
  function does not read config; it trusts its caller to pass a human-authored
  roster, and the caller side asserts that.
* **Strict canonicalization.** lowercase; a single ``local@domain``; **exact**
  domain equality (no parent/subdomain widening); **no** plus-tag stripping (a
  ``+tag`` local part is not widened to the bare local part); **no** display-name
  parsing. A loose match is a spoofing hole; an over-strict match only costs a
  draft. Anything that is not a clean bare address is UNKNOWN, not a guess.
* **Tainted provenance never classifies INTERNAL.** If the recipient address
  originated in untrusted/tainted content (``from_tainted=True``), the result is
  OUTSIDE even if it matches the roster — an injected "send to X" can never
  promote X to internal.

The typed outbound roster — CLIENT / VENDOR are independently-authored classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beyond the two-way internal/outside split, :func:`classify_recipients_typed`
resolves a send against a **typed outbound roster**: a human-authored list of
``(entry, class)`` pairs where ``class`` is a closed vocabulary of exactly
``client`` (the firm's own client) and ``records_vendor`` (a records provider).
These map to the ``external_send_client`` / ``external_send_vendor`` action
classes, each with its OWN authored, fail-closed ceiling — so an engagement can
graduate "chase our own client" or "chase the records vendor" to autonomous with
a one-line config change, without touching the outside class. Same hard rules as
the internal roster apply: **human-authored only** (never grown from inbound),
strict canonicalization (exact address or exact ``@domain`` equality, no plus-tag
widening, no display-name parsing, homoglyph-safe), and tainted provenance forces
OUTSIDE before any match. The vocabulary is closed BY DESIGN: there is no
"opposing counsel" or "court" class — an un-rostered outside recipient stays
:data:`RecipientClass.OUTSIDE`, governed by the outside ``external_send`` ceiling,
exactly as before. The classifier NEVER guesses: an address that matches entries
in more than one class resolves to OUTSIDE (the validators make this unreachable,
but the classifier does not depend on them). The 3-class functions
(:func:`classify_recipient`, :func:`classify_recipients`) are unchanged — the
reactive reply gate consumes them; only the proactive send gate reaches for the
typed variant.
