"""Voice Layer 2 — sample-driven draft transformation (issue #855).

Layer 1 (rules) lives in skill ``SKILL.md`` frontmatter — banned patterns,
required patterns, tone register. Layer 2 (this module) is the
example-driven rewrite: given a draft and the customer's voice profile
aggregated from structural-diff samples (PR #951), rewrite the draft so
its surface shape matches the customer's voice.

What this module rewrites
-------------------------

The transform performs **structural reshaping**: it adjusts the draft's
greeting line, signoff line, sentence-length distribution, and
paragraph rhythm so they line up with the per-cohort target profile.
Concretely:

* **Greeting swap** — if the customer's profile shows ``first_name``
  greetings and the draft opens with ``Dear Mr. Smith,`` (a formal-named
  greeting), the transform replaces the greeting line with the
  first-name variant. The recipient name is preserved verbatim from
  the draft — the transform never invents a name.

* **Signoff swap** — same logic on the closing line. If the profile is
  ``thanks`` and the draft closes with ``Sincerely,`` the transform
  swaps in ``Thanks,``. The printed signer line is preserved verbatim.

* **Sentence-length redistribution** — the draft's
  ``sentence_length_distribution`` is compared to the profile's. If the
  draft skews long where the profile skews short, the transform splits
  long sentences at clause boundaries (commas, semicolons, "and"/"but"
  conjunctions). If the draft skews short where the profile skews long,
  it joins adjacent short sentences with a conjunction. Joins and splits
  are conservative: a sentence is split only at a real clause boundary,
  and joins are limited to adjacent sentences in the same paragraph.

* **Paragraph density** — if the profile shows shorter paragraphs than
  the draft, the transform inserts paragraph breaks at sentence
  boundaries that already mark a topic shift (a sentence starting with
  ``Also``, ``Meanwhile``, ``As for``, ``On``, etc.). It does NOT split
  paragraphs at arbitrary points — that risks scrambling the draft's
  logical flow.

What this module REFUSES to do (fabrication discipline)
--------------------------------------------------------

The non-fabrication contract is the load-bearing safety property. The
transform must NEVER:

* Introduce new tokens that aren't already in the source draft except
  for the closed-vocabulary structural connectors documented in
  ``_ALLOWED_CONNECTORS`` (greeting/signoff phrase fragments, sentence-
  join conjunctions).

* Inject new entities (names, dates, dollar amounts, addresses, phone
  numbers, URLs, case numbers, matter IDs). If a token type matches one
  of these patterns and isn't already in the source draft, the
  transform must not produce it.

* Promise behavior, schedule meetings, accept obligations, or commit
  to deliverables. The voice transform never adds a sentence — it can
  only reshape sentences that are already there.

* Modify quoted content, signature blocks, or anything after the
  reviewer's printed signer line.

The empty-state principle (``docs/style/empty-state-pattern.md``)
applies: when the voice profile is unavailable, missing samples, or
unsuitable for the cohort, the transform returns the original draft
unchanged with a ``status="passthrough"`` reason recorded on the result.
A draft that cannot be safely reshaped is better than a draft that
fabricates content.

Performance contract
--------------------

The transform target is <2s p99 per draft. The implementation is pure
Python with no model calls and no network I/O — every operation is
either a regex substitution or a small string scan. Profiling notes:

* Greeting/signoff swap is one regex match + one line replacement.
* Sentence segmentation reuses :data:`_SENTENCE_SPLIT` from
  :mod:`adapter.voice.diff`.
* Sentence split/join performs at most one structural change per pair
  of adjacent sentences, capped at the number of bucket-delta units.
* Paragraph density reshaping inserts at most one paragraph break per
  topic-shift sentence.

In practice the transform completes in well under 50ms for typical
1-3 paragraph drafts; the 2s budget is the hard ceiling for very long
drafts (multi-paragraph status reports, summary letters) and exists to
backstop a future change that adds expensive analysis.

Voice profile aggregation
-------------------------

:class:`VoiceProfile` is the aggregated read-side model the transform
consumes. It is constructed by :func:`build_voice_profile` from a
sequence of :class:`StructuralDiff` objects — typically the samples
loaded from R2 for the active cohort. The aggregation:

* Averages :attr:`StructuralDiff.avg_sentence_length` across samples.
* Sums :attr:`StructuralDiff.sentence_length_distribution` bucket
  counts and normalizes to a probability distribution.
* Picks the modal :attr:`StructuralDiff.greeting_style` and
  :attr:`StructuralDiff.signoff_style` per cohort.
* Averages the :attr:`StructuralDiff.punctuation_rhythm` per-100-word
  rates.

A profile with fewer than :data:`MIN_PROFILE_SAMPLE_COUNT` samples is
considered insufficient. The transform's contract is to return
passthrough in that case — see ``docs/specs/operator/voice-gate-fallback.md``
for the surrounding gate doctrine.

Integration with the skill pipeline
-----------------------------------

The transform sits between the skill that authors a draft and the
``Email.create_draft`` capability call that lands it in the reviewer's
drafts folder. The Hermes overlay invokes the transform as part of the
draft-rendering pre-hook chain — see :class:`DraftTransformer.transform`
for the synchronous entry point.

The transform is idempotent: running it twice on the same draft against
the same profile is a no-op (the second pass sees a draft whose shape
already matches the target and makes no changes).

        Args:
            draft: The skill-authored draft body. Plain text; the
                transformer does not handle HTML. Leading/trailing
                whitespace is preserved.
            profile: Either a :class:`VoiceProfile` (legacy single-voice

                fallback ladder.
            reviewer_user_id: The `voice_profile_id` slug of the user
                who will approve and send this draft. Looked up against
                the bundle's per-user / per-(user, cohort) tables;
                ignored when `profile` is a bare :class:`VoiceProfile`.
                `None` means the caller did not thread reviewer identity
                through and the general profile applies.
            recipient_cohort: The recipient-cohort slug for the draft's
                target audience (`client`, `opposing-counsel`, `court`,
                `internal`, or a customer-extended slug per
                `customer.yaml :: voice_cohorts.cohorts`). Looked up
                against the bundle's `per_user_cohort` table; ignored
                when `profile` is a bare :class:`VoiceProfile`. `None`
