"""Partner-authored filter for voice samples (issue #856).

The voice library is the partner's voice, not the agent's. Samples that
the Operator drafted (and the partner sent unedited or lightly
edited) would feed the agent back its own output through Layer 2.

The filter has three signals, applied in this order:

1. ``SentItem.likely_agent_drafted`` — when the adapter populates this
   field (MS Graph and Gmail can tag drafts created by the agent's
   AgentMail identity), the filter trusts it. ``True`` means exclude.

2. Audit log cross-check — when the adapter does not populate the field
   (mobile clients, IMAP/SMTP), the filter consults the audit log for a
   ``DRAFT_CREATED`` row whose ``input_payload`` digest matches the
   sent message body. The lookup is by digest, not body — bodies are
   never persisted to the audit log either.

3. Body-shape heuristic — a final pass that excludes messages whose
   shape (length, structure, signature markers) matches the agent's
   draft templates. This is a soft signal and the only one that can
   produce false positives; rejecting a true partner-authored message
   has lower cost than admitting a stowaway AI-drafted message, so the
   filter biases toward exclusion when shape signals fire.

The filter does NOT inspect the recipient address or the matter to
decide partner-authoredness. Those are the cohort tag's job, and any
content-based filtering would be a privacy regression.

Output is a :class:`FilterResult` carrying the boolean decision and a
short reason string (max 200 chars) used by the dashboard's
"why was this excluded" drill-down.
