"""The runtime half of the ss#2284 cross-language parity contract.

``_canonicalize_roster_entry`` decides who a roster line names when a send is
classified on the seat. ``canonRosterAddress``
(``src/lib/operator/customer-yaml/sections-scope.ts``) decides whether two
authored spellings are "the same address" for the console validator's collision
rules. When they disagree, a config passes validation as two addresses and
resolves at runtime to one -- one human holding two silent exposure classes.

They DID disagree until 2026-09-01, measured on both real implementations: the
validator did a bare ``trim().toLowerCase()`` where this module NFC-normalizes,
and the two whitespace sets differed (JavaScript's ``\\s`` covers NBSP, the
ideographic space and the BOM; this module's explicit list did not).

This file and ``tests/roster-canon-parity.test.ts`` load the SAME fixture,
``operator/contracts/fixtures/roster-canon-cases.json``. Neither language can
move the rule alone.
