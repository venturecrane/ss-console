"""Identifier-integrity filter — provenance discipline for asserted identifiers.

A fabrication-discipline primitive in the same family as ``citation_filter.py``
(invariant #6) and the spec'd-but-unbuilt fabrication filter (invariant #8,
``docs/specs/operator/fabrication-filter.md``, issue #798). It is NOT invariant
#8 itself — #8 is the broader field-tag + source-existence filter. This module
covers one dimension of fabrication discipline that #798's field-tag approach
does not: **identifiers that appear in the free-text body of a draft.**

The distinction from ``citation_filter``:

- ``citation_filter`` *refuses* citation-shaped strings outright — a law message
  never cites, so any citation is a fabrication.
- ``identifier_filter`` *permits* identifiers but only when **provenance-
  verified**: every identifier-shaped token in a draft body must canonically
  match a token the agent actually **read** from a source this session (the
  provenance register). An A-number, client name, case number, or date the
  agent *composed* but never *read* is the runtime signature of a fabricated or
  garbled identifier — and a garbled USCIS name or a wrong filing date is a
  venture-killer.

Why a register, not a shape blocklist: you cannot tell a *correct* A-number from
a *fabricated* one by shape alone — both match ``A\\d{9}``. The only durable
signal is provenance: did the agent read this exact identifier this session?
This mirrors the citation-filter lesson (a prompt-level "use only real numbers"
instruction is insufficient; a code-level provenance check is the durable
answer).

Posture — REPORT-ONLY by default, and it NEVER hard-blocks
----------------------------------------------------------

Two deliberate choices, both from the plan's design review:

1. **Canonicalized matching, not byte matching.** A competent assistant
   *composes*: it writes "June 8, 2026" where the source said "6/8/26", strips
   an A-number's punctuation, or addresses "Robert Smith" where the matter says
   "Robert J. Smith". Byte-matching would flag exactly these polished, correct
   drafts while a lazy copy-paste passes — inverting the value gradient. So
   dates fold to a canonical ``YYYY-MM-DD``, identifiers strip punctuation, and
   names match on last-name + first-initial before being called "unverified".

2. **The filter reports; the caller sets the posture.** This module returns the
   unverified identifiers; the *caller* decides the action by ``Mode`` and its
   own policy. In ``REPORT`` mode it emits an audit signal only. In ``FLAG``
   mode it routes the draft to human review with the unverified identifiers
   annotated. The module itself never hard-blocks — but the deployed overlay
   caller REFUSES on unverified identifiers (ss #2171, Captain directive
   2026-08-02): the draft-class surface includes structured INTERNAL_WRITEs
   (a ``create_event`` lands on the firm calendar with no reviewer between),
   so annotation alone cannot back the "refuses rather than guesses"
   commitment. The refusal decision, its carve-outs (ambient dates,
   empty-register draft carve, NAME exclusion), and its rollback lever live
   in the overlay caller, not here.

This module is pure (no I/O, no state beyond the register the caller passes).
The overlay wires it onto the live output path (Tier-3 of ``outbound_gate``) and
builds the register by tapping read-class tool results — that is the Wave-2
overlay change; this is the canonical primitive it vendors.
