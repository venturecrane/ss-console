"""Sticky-stop circuit breaker for runaway agent loops (issue #843).

The platform PRD §7.5 invariant #4 says "don't act" instructions are sticky:
they survive context compaction, restart, and skill reload. That invariant
covers the OPERATOR-INITIATED pause path — a human pinning a stop. This
module covers the SYSTEM-INITIATED path: the substrate noticing the agent
is misbehaving (looping on a failing tool, refusing on every call, burning
budget, exceeding wall-clock time) and pinning a stop on its behalf before
a runaway loop can land work nobody asked for.

The two paths share a sticky-stop persistence layer (this module's
`sticky_stop_state` table, Machine-local SQLite per ADR 0062). An operator
pause and a system-pinned stop produce the same effect
on the dispatch path; the difference is the action_type tag recorded in
the audit log and the recovery surface (operator pauses clear by the same
human; system stops clear via Captain investigation).

Design rules:

* TWO states, forward-only: OK < HARD_STOP. The machine never DECREASES
  state autonomously; only Captain-initiated clear() resets to OK. WARN and
  SOFT_STOP were removed 2026-09-02 (Captain decision) after five days of a
  pilot seat sitting latched at SOFT_STOP while it restricted nothing and
  paged nobody. See StickyStopLevel for the full reasoning. The HARD_STOP
  thresholds did not move.

* Conditions are read from customer.yaml `safety.sticky_stop` if present;
  module-level DEFAULT_CONDITIONS apply otherwise. The defaults are
  intentionally conservative — easier to loosen via customer.yaml than to
  recover from a tighter-than-needed loop that ran for hours unnoticed.

* HARD_STOP semantics: dispatch refuses every skill invocation. The caller
  receives a StickyStopError it must propagate, NOT swallow. Same invariant
  as the audit log writer (issue #891): a state the substrate cannot
  enforce is a state the agent does not run.

* Captain recovery: `clear(customer, persona, captain_id, reason)` resets
  state to OK and emits an audit row. The Captain-verification mechanism
  is upstream (control-plane RBAC); this module trusts the caller to have
  established identity before invoking.

* Persistence: table `sticky_stop_state`, one row per (customer, persona)
  tuple, in Machine-local SQLite on the Fly volume (ADR 0062 — the
  per-customer-D1 placement this module originally assumed was never built
  and is retracted doctrine). The row's persona slug matches
  `customer.yaml.personas[].slug`.

* Audit emission: every state transition writes one StickyStopAuditRecord
  to the injected StickyStopAuditSink; each runtime adapts the record onto
  its native audit writer (ss-console: adapter.audit_log.AuditLogWriter;
  overlay: the broker-owned ledger emit path). Action type re-uses the
  existing closed-set vocabulary (ACCEPTED_ACTION_TYPES):

    - HARD_STOP entry     -> action_type=AGENT_STOPPED
    - a recorded overrun  -> action_type=INVARIANT_VIOLATION (no state change;
                             today only the time budget, which has no
                             HARD_STOP threshold of its own)
    - clear()             -> action_type=AGENT_RESUMED

  The transition detail (from_state, to_state, condition_triggered,
  sampled metric values) lives in the metadata column. This keeps the
  audit-log schema closed-set per d1-schema.md §1 while still carrying
  the structural information the compliance-evidence packet needs.

* Thread safety: SqliteStickyStopStore is the production store (Machine-
  local SQLite, ADR 0062) and the test store. It uses a single-writer
  connection and attempts no cross-row locks because state is partitioned
  per (customer, persona) and within one Hermes Machine the runtime is
  single-tenant. (The HttpD1StickyStopStore this docstring once promised
  is retired unbuilt with the per-customer-D1 premise.)

Module shape:

    state = StickyStopMachine(store=store, audit_writer=writer)

    # Record a tool failure and let the machine decide whether to transition
    new_state = await state.record_tool_failure(
        customer="acme",
        persona="marcus",
        skill_name="inbox-triage",
    )

    # Check current state on the dispatch path
    current = await state.get_state("acme", "marcus")
    if current.level == StickyStopLevel.HARD_STOP:
        raise StickyStopError(current)

    # Captain clears after investigation
    await state.clear(
        customer="acme",
        persona="marcus",
        captain_id="captain-scott",
        reason="confirmed false-positive tool flap; vendor recovered",
    )

The state machine has no async wakeup of its own. It transitions in
response to caller-driven events. Time-budget enforcement is therefore
a poll: callers feed `record_runtime_seconds()` per turn or per minute,
and the machine compares against the configured budget.
